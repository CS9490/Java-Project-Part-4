# Java-Project-Part-4
Showcasing Java skills in a project implementing JavaFX (fourth and final part).

This part of my JavaFX project built upon the previous three parts. The goal of this part was to connect MySQL and make a program which would scan a database which it is connected to and create (again) a pie chart showing the grades randomly generated students (which were in the MySQL Database) had. Additionally, the software would also output the number of students with all types of possible grades (named part D in the documentation). Examples of the code running are all present within the documentation. This project also showcases my use of MySQL and working with a relational database. In the documentation, there is also the ER Diagram of the schema that was used, as well as information pretaining to the 5 tables present within the schema that was used in this program.
